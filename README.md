# 📱 AndroidStd

**A no-BS Android Studio Android app template — built clean, structured smart, and ready to grow.**  
Think of this as your digital clay: form it into whatever app destiny you choose.

---

## 🌟 What This Is

This repository is a **standard Android project scaffold** — Kotlin first, Android Studio friendly, and meant for learning, hacking, remixing, and launching.  
It’s the way apps have always been built, but with fresh clarity and future room to stretch.

> Minimal → Understandable → Extendable

---

## 🛠️ Features

- 💡 **Kotlin-powered Android app**
- 🧠 Standard Android Studio project setup
- 📁 Organized folder structure (`app`, `gradle`, configs)
- 🔧 Gradle with sensible defaults
- 🚀 Ready for UI + feature layers (add your stuff fast)

*(This is your playground. Build screens, add logic, plug in APIs — go wild.)*

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone it

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vallabhatech/androidstd.git
```
### 2. Open in Android Studio

`File → Open → select the project folder`

Android Studio will do its thing — sync, index, and build.

### 3. Run on Emulator / Device

Hit the **Run ▶️** button, pick a target device, and boom — you’re live.

## 🧩 How It Works

This is classic Android app structure — the stuff you’ll see in docs, bootcamps, and industry stacks alike:

* `app/` — your app code (activities, layouts, resources)
* `build.gradle.kts` — Kotlin DSL build config
* `settings.gradle.kts` — workspace config
* `gradle/` — build tools

If you’ve ever booted up Android Studio before, this’ll feel like coming home.

## 🧠 Need to Add Stuff?

Here’s a basic roadmap:

✔ Create UI screens → `res/layout/`
✔ Add logic → `src/main/java/...`
✔ Define strings → `res/values/strings.xml`
✔ Add libraries → `build.gradle.kts`
